## üõ†Ô∏è Features

This portfolio is designed with a mobile-first approach but provides a distinct, enhanced experience for desktop users.

### üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Experience:
* **Interactive Hero Section:** A cursor-based masking effect that reveals a different background image, creating an engaging "spotlight" effect.
* **Custom Cursor:** A custom icon that follows the mouse within the hero section, enhancing the interactive feel.
* **Pulsating Animation:** The reveal area gently pulses to draw attention and add a dynamic touch.
* **Navbar Hover Effect:** An aesthetic "decode" text scrambling animation on navigation links when hovered.

### üì± Mobile & Tablet Experience:
* **Fully Responsive:** The layout, typography, and interactive elements are optimized for a seamless experience on all screen sizes.
* **Light/Dark Theme Toggle:** As cursor effects are not possible on touch devices, the functionality is replaced with a theme switcher. The toggle button swaps the main hero image between a "light mode" (smiling photo) and a "dark mode" (normal photo).
* **Persistent Theme:** Remembers the user's theme choice on their next visit by using the browser's `localStorage`.
* **Collapsible Hamburger Menu:** A clean, functional dropdown menu ensures easy navigation on smaller devices without cluttering the screen.

* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the website.

    * **Flexbox** for responsive alignment.
    * **CSS Variables** for theme management and dynamic properties.
    * **@property (Houdini)** for animating custom properties like `--radius`.
    * **Keyframe Animations** for the pulse and glitch effects.
    * **Media Queries** for creating the distinct desktop and mobile layouts.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactivity and state management.
    * **DOM Manipulation** to control all dynamic elements.
